# Salifort Motors: Predictive Model for Employee Turnover
Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate - Capstone Project

Objective: Design a model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company based on their job title, department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and any other relevant data points. 

XGBoost, Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN and Logistic Regression was used to predict employee turnover, with XGBoost resulting in a 96-98% accuracy.

Understanding Correlations and Feature Importance was key to coming up with strategic recommendations to increase employee retention.

**PACE Framework (Plan - Analyze - Construct - Execute)**
## Planning
To address employee turnover at Salifort Motors, this notebook will build a model to predict whether an employee will leave or stay based on different data points.
**Objectives**
1. **Identify Key Factors:** Use statistical and machine learning techniques to identify the primary factors that contribute to employee turnover.
2. **Predict Employee Turnover:** Build and validate predictive model to determine likelihood of employee turnover.
3. **Develop Retention Strategies:** Formulate strategies to improve employee satisfaction and retention.
## Analyze
In the analyze stage, the features contributing to employee turnover will be explored in depth, conducting tasks not limited to:
1. Understanding Data for Accurate Predictions
2. Data Exploration and Structuring
3. Exploring Predictor Variables
4. Feature Engineering
## Construct
Using the features we have selected, the model predicting employee turnover can be constructed. This will include steps:
1. Constructing the classification model
2. Hyperparameter Tuning
3. Model Training
4. Cross-Validation
## Execute
Lastly, we will evaluate the model performance in the execute stage, fine-tuning necessary areas before reiterating the steps to construct a more accurate classification model.
